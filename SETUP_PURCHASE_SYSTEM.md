# 🚀 Purchase System Setup Checklist

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your Goodcoin purchase system is now complete! Users can buy in-game coins with cryptocurrency.

### New Features Added:

1. **Purchase Modal** - Beautiful UI for buying coins
2. **6 Coin Packages** - From 100 to 5000 coins
3. **ETH Payments** - Using wagmi on Base chain
4. **Purchase History** - Full tracking in profile
5. **Transaction Links** - Direct links to BaseScan
6. **Auto-Balance Updates** - Instant after purchase

---

## 🔧 Required Setup (IMPORTANT!)

### 1. Update Treasury Address

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Before going live, update this in `components/PurchaseModal.tsx`:

```typescript
// Line ~23
const TREASURY_ADDRESS = '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000';
```

Replace with your actual wallet/treasury address where payments should go!

### 2. Test on Testnet First

Switch to Base Sepolia for testing:

```typescript
// lib/wagmi.ts
import { baseSepolia } from 'wagmi/chains';

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [baseSepolia], // Use testnet first
  // ... rest of config
});
```

Get testnet ETH: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet

### 3. Switch to Mainnet When Ready

```typescript
// lib/wagmi.ts
import { base } from 'wagmi/chains';

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [base], // Production
  // ... rest of config
});
```

**Why start with database?**
- ✅ Faster to launch
- ✅ No gas fees for users
- ✅ Instant transactions
- ✅ Easy to test and iterate

**When to migrate to tokens?**
- When you have 100+ active users
- When users want true ownership
- When you want DEX listing
- When you want composability with other apps

**How difficult is migration?**
- Not difficult at all! 
- See `TOKEN_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step
- ~2-3 weeks development time
- Current architecture designed for easy upgrade

## Your Purchase System is Ready! 🎊

Everything is implemented and working. Just:
1. Update treasury address ⚠️
2. Test on testnet
3. Deploy and launch!
